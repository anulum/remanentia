# Remanentia — recall gate (read-side honesty surface: render lattice + INV-4)

"""Decide how a recalled finding — and a synthesis over several — may render.

This is the read side of the fleet-memory honesty contract: the admission gate
(SYNAPSE ``admit()``, consumed by :mod:`finding_ingest`) decides what *enters*
the store; this gate decides how what was stored may be *presented* on recall, so
a synthesised answer never renders above its weakest input (the INV-4 invariant).

The contract is the SCPN-STUDIO keeper's recall-gate spec, derived verbatim from
the ``scpn-studio-platform`` 0.8.0 source (``evidence/conformance.py present()``,
``evidence/federation.py _propagate_provenance``). It is pure — no platform
import is needed — and re-implemented here for the read side; importing
``scpn_studio_platform.evidence`` (pin ``>=0.8,<0.9``) for parity is optional.

Each finding folds to one of three presentation modes — ``validated`` (the only
assertive state, established against a trusted reference), ``boundary`` (a hedged
claim, true only within a stated scope, never upgraded), or ``refuted`` (a
tested-false / falsified claim, first-class but never validated). A synthesis
renders at the **minimum** of its inputs' modes: all-validated renders validated,
any boundary floors to boundary, and a single refuted input floors the whole
synthesis to refuted — a tested-false input surfaces its refutation, it is never
laundered into a softer hedge (the keeper's ratified choice, confirmed read-side).

Unknown or undeclared members on a gating axis (evidence kind, claim status,
admission) withhold validation rather than crash — forward-tolerance: a consumer
that does not recognise a value renders it at the boundary, never above it.
